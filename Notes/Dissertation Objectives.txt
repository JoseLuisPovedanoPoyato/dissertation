Dissertation Objectives:

My objective for this dissertation is to create a benchmark that can be used effectively to test latency, resource usage of different SMTs.
To build on existing research the benchmark should 
	- Send a large number of requests to the server as kinvolk did to simulate the intensive usage websites have
	- Allow for multiple users (Threads? Async run wrk2?) as Elastisys did to send request so SMTs receive multiple, simultaneous requests (Not just multiple requests)
	- Our simulate systems with many microservices, benchmark should allow devs to choose how many microservices they want the benchmark to communicate between - I think this is new and no one does it

On the theoretical side I want to achieve a 'substantial' understanding of how each SMT works and their difference

The dissertation should introduce SMTs and what they are. Then provide a quick overview on how each works. (Include a feature comparison? - Most research recommends against this as they are rapidly growing and this becomes outdated very quickly) (Substantial Literature Review)
Then it should move on to explain how we designed our benchmark and why. We run the benchmark with different number of requests, users and microservices. (EXPERIMENT)
We explore results to analyse which SMT performs better.
