10th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: Apache ab works! I can measure request time when submitting a request to a specific service

Notes: 
- Automate apache ab load generation
	- Create some example requests
	- Select data I want to keep from the requests
	- Store results of each load
- After that -> Prometheus! 
	- We are not only interested on the latency difference between SMTs, we also want to know the resource usage between each one
- After that -> Implement the SMTs
	- Linkerd seems easier to implement than Istio, instead of trying to get Istio working again, this time start with linkerd, might help you understand what Istio is doing and why
