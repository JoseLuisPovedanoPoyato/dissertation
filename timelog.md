* * 0.5 hours * 2nd Meeting with Supervisor

### 07 Oct 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Investigation: For Docker containers to communicate they must be in the same Network, time to set up Kubernetes Cluster
* * 0.5 hours * Created kubernetes container and pod, cannot access services from localhost though
* * 0.5 hours * Created kubernetes service for receiver, still cannot access service from localhost

### 17 Oct 2022
* * 0.5 hour * Selected Objectives for dissertation

### 18 Oct 2022
* * 1 hour * Researched paper that implemented etcd on bare kubernetes and basic Istio, had very good explanation diagrams on Istio SMTs architecture vs bare
* * 0.5 hour * Basic microservice counter api to enable multiple deployments of same api and create loop of comms between them

## 19 Oct 2022
* * 1.5 hours * Installed Postman, finished and debugged microcounter api, it works locally
* * 1 hour * Researched kubernetes bare DNS - https://dev.to/narasimha1997/communication-between-microservices-in-a-kubernetes-cluster-1n41

## 20 Oct 2022
* * 1 hour * Services communicate via DNS inside kubernetes in docker distribution. This works fine and sender -> receiver works

## 23 Oct 2022
* * 1.5 hours * Created Architecture displaying how previous benchmarks worked, made proposing of my own and highlighted differences
* * 0.5 hours * Installing Istio -> Does not work on Windows with WSL2
* * 1 hour * Installed Ubuntu into WSL and set it up -> Kubernetes in Docker does not work

## 24 Oct 2022
* * 0.5 hour * 4th Meeting with superisor
* * 1 hour * Install Docker and Kube into ubuntu local version on wsl try and get them to work -> Docker not starting without running on main machine, WSL is secondary machine, cannot access main

## 25 Oct 2022
* * 1 hour * Logged onto Yehia's Server, installed docker and kubernetes and cloned project, docker works, kubectl gives errors -> Might need to set up kubernetes contexts

## 28 Oct 2022
* * 1 hour * Kubernetes distribution was not creating config for kubectl so kubectl did not know what kubernetes cluster to communicate with, manually created config
* * 0.5 hours * Kubernetes now creates deployments in cluster, however, pod is failing to pull image from docker -> Probably need to configure permissions?

## 30 Oct 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Updated objectives

## 03 November 2022 
* * 0.5 hours * Kubernetes was trying to pull image from online repo instead of sourcing it locally
* * 0.5 hours * kubernetes image was not being loaded automatically into pod when built unlike windows
* * 0.5 hours * Kubernetes image load was failing because kubernetes did not have permissions to interact with docker
* * 0 hours * Server now works like it did on windows distribution -> Onto Istio
* * 0.5 hours * 5th Meeting with supervisor

## 05 November 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Investigated potential limitations from previous benchmarks
* * 1 hour * Worked on experiment proposal, planned features to distinguish ourselves from previous benchmarks
 
## 06 November 2022
It was my birthday

## 08 November 2022
* * 1 hour * Created experiment proposal, with architecture and proposed technologies

## 10 November 2022
* * 1.5 hours * Installed Istio control plane for default version (Could not use Demo because Istio team reached out and complained to other benchmark about them using demo as it has limited capabilities)
* * 0.5 hours * 6th Meeting with supervisor

## 17 November 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Looked at Apache AB and checked it works for our objectives
* * 0.5 hours * 7th Meeting with supervisor - Had lots of uni work from other courses this week and did not have any progress

## 19 November 2022
* * 0.5 hour * Instead of getting sender and receiver working for every SMT and then implement experiment, get experiment working on base kubernetes (less total work, though harder to start)
* * 0.5 hour * Started looking into pods replicas and investigating how services would work.

## 23 November
* * 1 hour * Finished project dissertation report draft - Submitted to Yehia for feedback

## 24 November 2022
* * 0.5 hours * 8th Meeting with supervisor

## 30 November 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Kept working on replicas, docker is failing locally
* * 1 hour * Tried to debug local version of docker, not working, moving on to build on Server because I do not want to waste more time on this

## 01 December 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Image builds in docker on server
* * 0.5 hours * Image deploys to kubernetes with multiple replica pods and services
* * 1 hour * Learned how kubernetes load balancing works from service to replicas, they will ping the same replica until that one is full then move to the next one

## 02 December 2022
* * 1 hour * MicroCounter works on server - Need to test with apache ab to check loop
* * 0.5 hours * Image deploys to kubernetes with multiple replica pods and services
* * 0.5 hours * 9th meeting with Yehia

## 05 December 2022
* * 1.5 hours * Apache ab tested on kube pod, microcounter works and times requests 
		- To investigate: Ensure all pods are pinged and not just 1
* * 1.5 hours * Started automatising ab into its own pod that will send requests from list of requests and record them into file

## 08 December 2022
* * 0.5 hours * 10th Meeting with Yehia

## 13 December 2022
* * 1 hour * Created sample requests, created python script that iterates over them, runs ab from command line and extracts data
	- Still need to choose what of this data I want to record 
* * 2.5 hours * Debugged python script so it worked on docker and it deploys to kubernetes 
* * 0.5 hours * Updated project status with Yehia's Feedback

## 14 December 2022
* * 0.5 hours * 11th meeting with Yehia -> Will meet again after Christmas

## 16 December 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Finishing touches to Status Report and submitted it

## 17 December 2022
* * 1 hour * Researched Prometheus, worked on ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBinding to monitoring namespace
	- Prometheus is more complicated than expected

## 20 December 2022
* * 1 hour * Kept trying to set up Prometheus -> Lots of stuff I don't understand
* * 1.5 hours * Instead found pre-made Prometheus template -> Deploying that -> Adapt to match what I need
	- Problem1: Cannot SSH into container to access logs
		- Potential WorkAround: Deploy other service to same namespace and ping it from there (This won't work, problem is with pinging)
	- Problem2: Not sure how metrics are defined to be store, or how to query them
		WorkAround: Look into rules and prometheus.yaml (Yehia said metrics can be sent to a separate pod)
* * 1.5 hours * Test ExternalName in DNS for monitoring namespace from default namespace
	- ExternalNames works we can communicate accros namespaces
	- Problem: When trying to query prometheus, even from same namespace, requests hang and never return anything
* * 0.5 hours * Updated experiment description and diagrams
* * 0.5 hours * Updated apache timelog to select more values and formated data storage
 
 
## 21 December 2022
* * 1.5 hour * Created controller to store timelog values over multiple different uploads of SMTs

## 22 December 2022
* * 3 hours * Controller works, will run multiple version of apache ab with different concurrencies, number of requests and num of microservices
	- To Do: Increase apache ab timeout
	- To Do: Read logs from stderror as well to facilitate future debugging
	
## 23 December 2022
* * 0.5 hours * Increased timeout and output error logs
