4th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: Created Microcounter which locally loops back to itself, sender and receiver services communicate to each other on bare kubernetes through kube's default DNS
Created objectives draft and tried using Istio locally, having compatibility issues with Istio running on my windows computer.

Notes: 
New focus is to get Sender and Receiver working with the SMT. Try getting it working on a VM of Ubuntu.
Yehia will try to provide me with server for project.
