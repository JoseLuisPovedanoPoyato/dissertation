11th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: Load generation has been automated with apache ab, now a pod will use apache ab to send a specific number of requests.

Notes: 
- Consider what data I want to store from the apache ab requests
	- Currently the times per requests, but other data could also be interesting
- Start implementing Prometheus
	- We need to record the resource usage of each pod
- After that -> Implement the SMTs
	- Linkerd seems easier to implement than Istio, instead of trying to get Istio working again, this time start with linkerd, might help you understand what Istio is doing and why
