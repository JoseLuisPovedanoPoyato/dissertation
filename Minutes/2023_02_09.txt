15th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: Currently the benchmark crashes the server very frequently, looking at methods to solve this.
Currently trying to downgrade the deployment to a lower scale.

Created multiple graphs, some of the data in them is weird.


Notes: Rerun the experiment to check the latency and keep adjusting the experiment scale
