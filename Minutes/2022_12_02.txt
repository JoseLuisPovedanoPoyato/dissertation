9th meeting with Supervisor

Updates: Deployed microcounter to bare kubernetes and it works, Deployment scales up and down with replicas, Researched how different SMTs load balance

Question: 
Should I let the SMTs load balance? Or should I dictate the path through which requests flow?
	- e.g. Kubernetes uses the same pod until its usage reaches capacity then moves to a diff one
	- e.g. Linkerd starts distributing requests over diff pods when usage hits 20%
	
	- I think its best to let the SMTs load balance as not doing this means we would only be testing the proxies
		- An SMT could have a better proxy, but another one could make up for it with smarter load balancing

Notes: 
Start working on measuring latency from requests using apache ab.
Project Status Report due soon, update with Yehia's feedback from email.
Exams are next week, so might not get much done.
