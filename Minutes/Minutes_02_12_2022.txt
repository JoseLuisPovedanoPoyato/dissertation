9th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: I now succesfully deploy multiple versions of microcounter to kubernetes and the counting functionality works
	- Explored the different ways SMTs load balance, bare kubernetes will use the same deployment until its usage is at its max then use another deployment
	- Linkerd will start load balancing when it hits 20%
	- Istio depends on version used

Questions:
	- Should I let the SMTs load balance? Or should I force them to follow a path?
		- I think I should let them load balance because if I don't I would just be comparing proxy speed, where we already know linkerd has the edge, load balancing might turn it around

Notes: 
- I have exams next week, so might not get much dissertation work done
- Usually uni courses are 20% coursework 80% exam, I took mostly coursework based courses, so it was noticeable I had less time for dissertation than expected
	- This is fine, it just means I have to catch up now during exam sessions and christmas
- I am flying home right after my exams, need to check uni VPN still works from there so I can keep doing diss work
