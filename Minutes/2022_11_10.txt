6th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: Created experiment proposal and installed Istio Control Plane.
 
Notes: 
Experiment is good but consider alternative technologies - Apache AB is a good option to send multiple requests and stress test without threading
In cases like Istio, when there are multiple versions of the SMT explain why did you pick that one
Start thinking about status report, due halfway through December
