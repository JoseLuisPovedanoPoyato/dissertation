5th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: VM with Ubuntu on local computer had issues. Instead moved on to Yehia's Server. There were some issues with requirements,
however receiver and sender are now up to date with local progress. Updated objectives to abstract the methodology from them.

Notes: Start thinking about experiment, what do we want to measure and how?
How is this novel? How is this different from previous literature?
