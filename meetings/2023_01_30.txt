14th meeting with Supervisor
Updates: No major differences found when meshing Benchmark Controller and not meshing it.
Implementing resource collection, currently Prometheus is querying places for metrics but don't know how to expose the correct metrics or which exposing tech I should use
There is cadvisor, node exporter and metrics server.

Notes: Try the different resource technologies and pick one.

We went over the different ways to display the data once collected. CDFs for latency could be a good idea.
